## Recommendation

**Polygon PoS** is recommended as the primary blockchain for Vaulté based on:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Lowest gas fees, critical for marketplace operations
2. **Speed**: Fast finality for responsive user experience
3. **Ecosystem**: Largest developer community and tooling
4. **Privacy Options**: Better support for privacy solutions
5. **Maturity**: Proven track record with major projects

### Implementation Plan

1. Deploy initial contracts on Polygon Mumbai testnet
2. Conduct thorough gas optimization
3. Implement cross-chain bridges for future expansion to Arbitrum/Optimism
4. Deploy production contracts on Polygon mainnet

### Risk Mitigation

While Polygon is recommended, we should design contracts with cross-chain compatibility in mind to allow future migration if needed.
