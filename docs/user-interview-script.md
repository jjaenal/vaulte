# Vaulté — User Interview Script (Data Privacy & Marketplace)

## Purpose
Understand users’ expectations, concerns, and behaviors around sharing, controlling, and monetizing their personal data.

## Instructions
- Interview length: 20–30 minutes
- Audience: Consumers with digital footprints (fitness, finance, browsing)
- Approach: Conversational; follow-ups encouraged; avoid leading questions

## Questions
1. How do you currently feel about companies collecting your personal data?
2. Have you ever received tangible value from sharing your data? If yes, how?
3. What types of your data do you consider sensitive vs. shareable (e.g., fitness, finance, location)? Why?
4. In your ideal world, what control would you have over your data (who, when, how long)?
5. Would you be willing to sell parts of your data directly to buyers if privacy is preserved? Why/why not?
6. What price feels fair for granting time‑bound access to your data (daily/monthly)?
7. How important is transparency about data access (logs, audit trails, revocation)?
8. What would make you trust a marketplace to handle your data securely?
9. How do you decide whether an app is trustworthy enough to connect your data sources (Google Fit, bank APIs)?
10. If a buyer requests your data, what information do you want before approving (purpose, duration, payment, terms)?
11. How should refunds or revocations be handled if you change your mind mid‑access period?
12. What’s your tolerance for technical steps (wallet setup, encryption keys, permissions)?
13. Would you prefer fixed prices or auction/bid‑based pricing for your data categories?
14. Which features would make you use such a marketplace regularly (notifications, dashboards, reputation)?
15. What risks would prevent you from using a data marketplace (privacy breach, misuse, complexity)?

## Optional Probes
- Views on zero‑knowledge proofs or anonymization
- Comfort with recurring access subscriptions vs. one‑off purchases
- Willingness to participate in reputation or dispute resolution systems
