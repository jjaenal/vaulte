# VaultÃ© - Strategic Roadmap

## Decentralized Personal Data Marketplace

---

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**Brand**: VaultÃ© (pronunciation: vohl-tay)

**Vision**: Empower individuals to monetize their personal data while maintaining full control and privacy.

**Mission**: Build a decentralized marketplace where users sell data directly to buyers, cutting out middlemen and ensuring transparency.

**Tagline**: "Your data, elevated"

**Target Launch**: 6 months (MVP)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Months 1-3)

### Month 1: Research & Architecture

**Week 1-2: Market Research & Validation**

The foundation of VaultÃ© starts with understanding the market deeply. We'll conduct qualitative interviews with 20 potential users to understand their data privacy concerns, current frustrations with big tech, and willingness to monetize their data. On the buyer side, we'll survey 10 potential data buyers including academic researchers, small marketing agencies, and health tech companies to validate demand and understand their data acquisition challenges.

Competitor analysis will focus on Ocean Protocol, Streamr, and traditional data brokers to identify gaps in the market. We'll map out our unique value proposition: combining user-friendly UX (unlike complex crypto platforms) with true data ownership and transparent pricing.

**Week 3-4: Technical Architecture**

Critical technical decisions will be finalized:

- **Blockchain selection**: Polygon mainnet for low gas fees and fast transactions. Fallback option: Arbitrum if Polygon has issues.
- **Storage layer**: Hybrid approach - IPFS for decentralized storage with Pinata pinning service, PostgreSQL for metadata and user profiles.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router for performance and SEO.
- **Smart contracts**: Hardhat for development with comprehensive testing suite.

System architecture will include detailed data flow diagrams showing how user data moves from source â†’ encryption â†’ IPFS storage â†’ smart contract permission management â†’ buyer access. Security architecture will implement zero-knowledge proofs for data verification without exposure.
