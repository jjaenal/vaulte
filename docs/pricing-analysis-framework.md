# VaultÃ© - Pricing Analysis Framework

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This framework analyzes willingness to pay (WTP) and data preferences from user research to inform VaultÃ©'s pricing strategy and feature prioritization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Determine optimal pricing tiers** for different data categories
- **Identify price sensitivity** across user segments
- **Understand value perception** of data privacy/control features
- **Validate freemium vs premium** model assumptions

### Secondary Goals
- **Segment users** by willingness to pay
- **Identify feature-price correlations**
- **Benchmark against competitors**
- **Forecast revenue potential**

---

## ðŸ’° Willingness to Pay (WTP) Analysis

### 1. Data Collection Sources

#### From Buyer Survey (`docs/buyer-survey.md`)
- **Q8**: Budget range per data category
- **Q9**: Pricing model preference (one-time, subscription, pay-per-use)
- **Q10**: Maximum acceptable price points

#### From User Interviews (`docs/user-interview-script.md`)
- **Section 4**: Monetization & Pricing questions
- **Follow-up probes** on price sensitivity
- **Competitive pricing** comparisons

#### From User Personas (`docs/user-personas.md`)
- **Alex Chen**: $50-200/month (high-value professional data)
- **Maria Rodriguez**: $10-50/month (health/fitness data)
- **David Kim**: $100-500/month (research datasets)
- **Sarah Thompson**: $5-25/month (gig economy data)
- **Robert Johnson**: $20-100/month (privacy-focused data)

### 2. WTP Analysis Methodology

#### Step 1: Data Segmentation
```
Segment by:
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Category
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Health/Fitness ($10-50/month)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Professional/Career ($50-200/month)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Financial ($25-100/month)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Location/Travel ($5-30/month)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Research/Academic ($100-500/month)
â”œâ”€â”€ User Type
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Individual Sellers (lower WTP)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Data Buyers/Researchers (higher WTP)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Privacy Advocates (premium for control)
â””â”€â”€ Geographic Region
    â”œâ”€â”€ US/EU (higher WTP)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Asia-Pacific (medium WTP)
    â””â”€â”€ Emerging Markets (lower WTP)
```

#### Step 2: Price Point Analysis
```
For each segment, calculate:
â”œâ”€â”€ Mean WTP
â”œâ”€â”€ Median WTP
â”œâ”€â”€ 25th/75th percentile
â”œâ”€â”€ Price elasticity estimate
â””â”€â”€ Confidence intervals
```

#### Step 3: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter
Ask users 4 key questions:
1. **Too Cheap**: "At what price would you consider this too cheap to be good quality?"
2. **Bargain**: "At what price would you consider this a bargain?"
3. **Expensive**: "At what price would you consider this expensive but still worth buying?"
4. **Too Expensive**: "At what price would you consider this too expensive?"

#### Step 4: Competitive Benchmarking
```
Compare against:
â”œâ”€â”€ Google/Facebook Ad Revenue per User ($20-40/month)
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Broker Prices ($0.50-5.00 per record)
â”œâ”€â”€ Survey Platforms ($1-10 per response)
â”œâ”€â”€ Fitness App Subscriptions ($5-30/month)
â””â”€â”€ Privacy Tools ($5-15/month)
```

### 3. WTP Calculation Framework

#### Revenue Per User Per Month (RPUPM)
```
RPUPM = (Data Categories Ã— Avg Price Ã— Usage Frequency) - Platform Fee

Example:
- Health Data: $25/month Ã— 1 category = $25
- Professional Data: $100/month Ã— 2 categories = $200
- Platform Fee (10%): -$22.50
- Net RPUPM: $202.50
```

#### Price Elasticity Estimation
```
Price Elasticity = % Change in Demand / % Change in Price

Target Elasticity:
â”œâ”€â”€ Essential Data (Health): -0.5 to -1.0 (inelastic)
â”œâ”€â”€ Professional Data: -1.0 to -1.5 (unit elastic)
â””â”€â”€ Luxury Data (Travel): -1.5 to -2.5 (elastic)
```
